                                we should resize the stones by using medicines or treatments like ESWL,PCNL,LASER-RIRS,URSL and PCCL and should take proper food like drinking three litres of water etc.</p>

                                       <li> Sometimes stones pass from the kidney into the ureters and don’t always abide in the kidney. Ureters are tiny and sensitive, and the stones may be too large to go smoothly down the ureter to the bladder.</li>
                                       <li> Passage of stones down the ureter can lead to spasms and irritation of the ureters. This results in blood to appear in the urine.</li>
                                       <li> Sometimes the flow of urine is blocked by these stones. This is called a urinary obstruction. Urinary obstructions can result in kidney infection and kidney damage.</li>

                                <li>Infection of the bladder (cystitis). This type of UTI is usually caused by Escherichia coli (E. coli), a type of bacteria commonly found in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. However, sometimes other bacteria are responsible.</li>
                                <li> Sexual intercourse may lead to cystitis, but you don't have to be sexually active to develop it. All women are at risk of cystitis because of their anatomy — specifically, the short distance from the urethra to the anus and the urethral opening to the bladder.</li>
                                <li>Infection of the urethra (urethritis). This type of UTI can occur when GI bacteria spread from the anus to the urethra. Also, because the female urethra is close to the vagina, sexually transmitted infections, such as herpes, gonorrhea, chlamydia and mycoplasma, can cause urethritis.</li>

                            <p>The presence of Kidney Stones in the human body can cause immense pain and discomfort. It becomes essential to get rid of the stones so that the normal activities of life continue uninterrupted.
                                 There are different procedures to get rid of the stones. If the stone is larger and cannot dispose while urination and gets stuck in the urinary tract, then surgery becomes the obvious choice.</p>

                                <li>A kidney stone usually will not cause symptoms until it moves around within your kidney or passes into your ureters — the tubes connecting the kidneys and the bladder. If it becomes lodged in the ureters, it may block the flow of urine and cause the kidney to swell and the ureter to spasm, which can be very painful. At that point, you may experience these signs and symptoms:</li>
                                <li><strong>1.</strong> Severe, sharp pain in the side and back, below the ribs</li>
                                <li><strong>2.</strong> Pain that radiates to the lower abdomen</li>
                                <li><strong>3.</strong> Pain that comes in waves and fluctuates in intensity</li>
                                <li><strong>4.</strong> Pain or burning sensation while urinating</li>

                                <li>Laparoscopy is a surgical diagnostic procedure used to examine the organs inside the abdomen. It’s a low-risk, minimally invasive procedure that requires only small incisions.</li>
                                <li>Laparoscopy uses an instrument called a laparoscope to look at the abdominal organs. A laparoscope is a long, thin tube with a high-intensity light and a high-resolution camera at the front. The instrument is inserted through an incision in the abdominal wall. As it moves along, the camera sends images to a video monitor.</li>

                                        <li>Laparoscopy is often used to identify and diagnose the source of pelvic or abdominal pain. It’s usually performed when noninvasive methods are unable to help with diagnosis.</li>
                                        <li>Ultrasound, which uses high-frequency sound waves to create images of the body CT scan, which is a series of special X-rays that take cross-sectional images of the body MRI scan, which uses magnets and radio waves to produce images of the body</li>

                                <li><strong>Treatment:</strong> You should tell your doctor about any prescription or over-the-counter medications you’re taking. Your doctor will tell you how they should be used before and after the procedure.</li>
                                <li><strong>Results of laparoscopy:</strong> If a biopsy was taken, a pathologist will examine it. A pathologist is a doctor who specializes in tissue analysis. A report detailing the results will be sent to your doctor.</li>

                                <li> Kidney Cancer: It is a type of cancer that starts in the cells in the kidney. The two most common types of kidney cancer are Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) and Urothelial Cell Carcinoma (UCC) of the renal pelvis. These names reflect the type of cell from which the cancer developed. The different types of kidney cancer (such as RCC and UCC) develop in different ways, meaning that the diseases have different outlooks (or prognosis), and need to be staged and treated in different ways. RCC is responsible for approximately 80% of primary renal cancers, and UCC accounts the majority of the remainder.</li>
                                <li>Bladder Cancer: This includes any of the several types of malignancy arising from the epithelial lining (i.e. the urothelium) of the urinary bladder. Rarely the bladder is involved by non-epithelial cancers, such as lymphoma or sarcoma, but these are not ordinarily included in the colloquial term 'bladder cancer'. It is a disease in which abnormal cells multiply without control in the bladder. The bladder is a hollow, muscular organ that stores urine and is located in the pelvis. The most common type of bladder cancer recapitulates the normal histology of the urothelium and is known as transitional cell carcinoma or more properly urothelial cell carcinoma.</li>

                                     is also called end-stage renal disease, or ESRD for short. Diabetes is the most common cause of ESRD. </p>

                                        <ul class="custom-symptoms-list">
                                            <li> Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs): UTIs are bacterial infections that can affect any part of the urinary tract. Women are more prone to UTIs due to their shorter urethra, which allows bacteria easier access to the bladder. Symptoms may include frequent and painful urination, a strong urge to urinate, cloudy or bloody urine, and pelvic pain.</li>
                                            <li> Urinary Incontinence: This condition involves involuntary leakage of urine, which can occur during activities such as coughing, sneezing, laughing, or exercising (stress incontinence), or with a sudden, strong urge to urinate (urge incontinence). Mixed incontinence involves a combination of both stress and urge incontinence. Causes can include weakened pelvic floor muscles, nerve damage, hormonal changes, and certain medical conditions.</li>
                                            <li> Overactive Bladder (OAB): OAB is characterized by a sudden and uncontrollable urge to urinate, often accompanied by frequency (urinating more than eight times a day) and nocturia (waking up to urinate at night). It can significantly impact quality of life and may be caused by various factors such as bladder muscle overactivity, neurological disorders, or bladder irritation.</li>
                                            <li> Interstitial Cystitis/Bladder Pain Syndrome (IC/BPS): IC/BPS is a chronic condition characterized by bladder pain or discomfort, along with urinary frequency and urgency. The exact cause is unknown, but it's believed to involve inflammation of the bladder lining. Symptoms may resemble those of a UTI but without bacterial infection, and they can vary in severity over time.</li>
                                            <li> Pelvic Organ Prolapse (POP): POP occurs when the pelvic organs (bladder, uterus, or rectum) descend into the vaginal space due to weakened pelvic floor muscles and ligaments. This can lead to urinary symptoms such as urinary urgency, frequency, incomplete emptying, and stress urinary incontinence.</li>
                                            <li> Urinary Retention: Urinary retention is the inability to empty the bladder completely. It can be acute or chronic and may result from various factors such as blockage of the urinary tract, nerve damage, or weak bladder muscles. Symptoms include difficulty starting urination, weak urine stream, and a sensation of incomplete emptying.</li>
