This is the minified (compressed) source code for **SlickNav**, a responsive mobile menu plugin for jQuery. It transforms a traditional desktop navigation menu into a mobile-friendly, touch-optimized dropdown menu (often referred to as a "hamburger menu").

### **What SlickNav Does in Your Hospital Website**
1. **Mobile-Friendly Navigation**  
   - Converts your desktop menu into a collapsible, touch-friendly menu for smartphones and tablets.
   - Works with nested submenus (dropdowns), which is useful for multi-level hospital site navigation (e.g., "Departments > Cardiology > Services").

2. **Accessibility Features**  
   - Adds ARIA attributes (`aria-haspopup`, `role="menu"`, etc.) for screen readers.
   - Supports keyboard navigation (Arrow keys, Enter, Escape).

3. **Customizable Design**  
   - Allows branding (e.g., hospital logo in the menu).
   - Supports animations (slide-down/slide-up effects).
   - Configurable symbols for expanded/collapsed states (e.g., `►` for closed, `▼` for open).

4. **Performance Optimized**  
   - Clones the original menu (to preserve SEO structure) but removes unnecessary IDs/classes/styles for mobile.

5. **Responsive Behavior**  
   - Automatically collapses on small screens and expands when the "hamburger" icon is clicked.

### **Why It’s Used in a Hospital Website**
- **Mobile Usability**: Ensures patients and visitors can easily navigate the site on phones/tablets.
- **Emergency Access**: Critical links (e.g., "Emergency Contacts," "Find a Doctor") remain accessible.
- **Compliance**: Helps meet accessibility standards (WCAG) for users with disabilities.

### **Key Features in the Code**
- **Hamburger Button**: Created dynamically with `slicknav_btn` and `slicknav_icon-bar` classes.
- **Submenu Handling**: Toggles nested menus with symbols (e.g., `►`/`▼`).
- **Event Listeners**: Handles clicks, touch events, and keyboard interactions.
- **Configuration Options**:  
  - `label`: Text for the menu button (e.g., "MENU").  
  - `duration`: Animation speed.  
  - `parentTag`: HTML tag for parent items (default: `<a>`).  
  - `closeOnClick`: Closes menu after selecting an item.  

### **Should You Modify It?**
- This is the **minified** version, so editing it directly is not recommended.
- Customizations (e.g., colors, animations) should be done via CSS or the plugin’s [configuration options](https://github.com/ComputerWolf/SlickNav#options).

### **Example of How It’s Initialized**
```javascript
$(document).ready(function(){
  $('#main-menu').slicknav({
    label: 'MENU',          // Button text
    prependTo: '#header',   // Where to place the mobile menu
    allowParentLinks: true  // Let parent items be clickable
  });
});
```
