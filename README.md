# Hospital-Website is a responsive static website I built using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. It’s designed specifically for a hospital, with pages for doctors, services, a gallery, and contact details. Unlike generic templates, it’s tailored to healthcare needs, focusing on clear navigation and patient-friendly information. Since it’s static, it’s lightweight, fast, and easy to deploy on platforms like GitHub Pages or Netlify. The project demonstrates my ability to build domain-specific, professional websites, and it can be extended with features like appointment booking or a patient portal.
